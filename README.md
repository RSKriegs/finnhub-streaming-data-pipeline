# Finnhub Streaming Data Pipeline

The project is a streaming data pipeline based on Finnhub.io API/websocket real-time trading data created for a sake of my master's thesis related to stream processing.
It is designed with a purpose to showcase key aspects of streaming pipeline development & architecture, providing low latency, scalability & availability.
The pipeline bases on Apache Spark, Apache Kafka & Kubernetes as key tools utilized in this project.
